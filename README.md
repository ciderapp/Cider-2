## Technologies Used

Cider-2 utilizes a range of technologies to deliver a seamless user experience:

- **Vue.js:** Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It offers a reactive and component-based architecture, making it ideal for creating dynamic web applications.

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. It provides static type-checking, making it easier to catch errors during development.

- **Electron and Tauri:** Cider-2 leverages Electron for platforms other than Windows, while it uses Tauri specifically for the Windows platform. Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies, and Tauri is a cross-platform framework that allows creating native Windows executables using web technologies.

## FAQs

Currently, lossless playback is not supported in Cider-2. While Apple's MusicKit Framework does have lossless support, decryption of this audio is not currently supported.

Tauri uses webkit2gtk, which does not support web security disabling, a requirement for Apple's API. Therefore, Tauri is not used on Linux for Cider-2.
