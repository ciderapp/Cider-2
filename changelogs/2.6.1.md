# Cider 2.6.1

**Requires a full client update for macOS and Linux** from [Cider Taproom](https://taproom.cider.sh) or [itch.io](https://itch.io)

This release focuses on major improvements to playlist and album pages, enhanced audio features, and numerous bug fixes.

## Major Features

### New Rewritten Playlist and Album Pages
We've rewritten some of the oldest code in Cider and it's better than ever:
- Separated playlist and album logic to allow for better a tailored experience for each one
- Improved loading times
- Improvements to responsive layouts

#### Playlist Specific Improvements
- **Drag and Drop Arrangement**: Tracks can now be arranged without entering the Edit Tracklist mode
  - Edit Tracklist will remain available for touch screen users under the menu
- **Smarter Track Management**: Smarter track fetching and refresh handling
- **Better Suggestions**: Playlist track suggestions that get added now get removed from the suggestion list to allow new suggestions to take their place

#### Album Specific Improvements
- **Enhanced Editorial Layout**: Now affects more of the album page than before
  - On Calico layout, the top bar colors are now adapted to the editorial banners colors
- **Catalog Parity**: Library albums now feature the same content as the catalog versions when available
  - Editorial artwork
  - Animated artwork
  - Curator notes
- **Better Organization**: Discs numbers are now displayed in the track list and can be collapsed
- **Improved Details**: More detailed curator notes and tracks now only show the artist names when there are multiple artists
- **Quality Badges**: Added Apple Digital Master badging to albums

## Audio Enhancements

### Cider Audio Changes
- **Split Architecture**: Split Cider Audio Labs from Cider Audio
  - More Cider Audio Labs presets by Maikiwi are now available from the Marketplace and are updateable independent from Cider itself
  - If you were using a preset that has been moved to the marketplace you will be prompted on startup to download the plugin to restore your previous settings
- **Fixed Audio Normalization**: Resolved audio normalization not working in previous version
- **New UI**: The Audio Settings UI now slides in from the top and can be collapsed temporarily to allow changing other settings and tracks while fine-tuning your settings

### New Spatial Presets

- Maikiwi ('25 Signature B)

## General Improvements

- **Marketplace Caching**: Marketplace listings are now cached on client

- **Sidebar Persistence**: Right sidebar state is now preserved when switching between the main UI and Immersive
- **Smaller Updates**: Reduced OTA update bundle size
- **Discord Integration**: Added song.link button to Discord RPC

## Notable Bug Fixes

- **UI Immersive**: Restored UI Immersive background settings that were removed accidentally in the previous major update
- **Audio Localization**: Fixed issue where Cider Audio "Atmosphere Realizers" were not localizing properly
- **Startup Loading**: Fixed an issue where pages on startup would not fully load their content due to an invalid language query
- **Discord RPC**: Fixes related to Discord RPC buttons
- **Library Management**: Fixed issue where some "Add to Library" buttons would add items twice
