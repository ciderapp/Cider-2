# Cider 2.3.1

This release focuses on bug fixes and security improvements, particularly around RPC functionality and overall application stability.

## Bug Fixes

### Various Bug Fixes
This release addresses several critical issues including:
- Fixed an issue where playlist listings would not load properly
- Resolved animated artwork not playing correctly
- Fixed user-defined CSS not loading properly
- Multiple other stability and functionality improvements

## Security Enhancements

### Increased Security
RPC is now no longer enabled by default and is behind a toggle. This is one of many steps we will be taking to ensure the security of our users. This change provides better control over external access to Cider's functionality.

### Improvements to RPC and WebSockets API
We have made improvements to the RPC and WebSockets API to make it more reliable and secure. These enhancements provide better stability and security for users who choose to enable these features.

## Security Focus

This release represents our commitment to user security and data protection. By making RPC opt-in rather than enabled by default, we're taking proactive steps to ensure that users have full control over their privacy and security settings.

## Additional Improvements

- Enhanced stability across various application components
- Better error handling and reporting
- Improved performance for media loading and display
- More robust API communications
